It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

question 2: there is a balance of 0 after printing a ticket
question 3: integrer number too large, no refunds, even if the balance isn't enough it prints a ticket anyway
question 5: the "cents" value is different (meaning that the price value is different)
question 7: yes it does. the correct order would be "visibility modifier", "type" and "variable name". the correct way to write it would then be "public class TicketMachine". when instead compiling "class public TicketMachine", BlueJ detects an error.
